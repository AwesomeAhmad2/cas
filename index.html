							<h2>Sandhurst</h2>

						<div class="content">
							<p><strong>Activity </strong>During the summer, I was sponsored by the MiSK organization to travel to the Sandhurst Royal Military academy for the purpose of primarily developing my leadership and follower ship skills. During my time there, we got lectured and was put through a rigorous physical assault course which cadets there took on a daily basis. The course built-on our teamwork skills and exposed us to a stressful environment where we had to corporate in order to succeed. It also gave us an outlook on struggles that cadets must undergo to graduate from the academy. I found the course to be challenging because I lacked the physical capacities required for the course. We also did hands-on team training activities to develop our leadership skills, specifically with our teams.</p>

						<h2>Recycling Program</h2>
					</header>
					<div class="content">
						<p><strong>Service </strong>During the first month of school, we started planning out our recycling idea. We talked to supervisors, teachers, and the administrator to formulate the idea and get their feedback. We (Mohammed FM & Abdulaziz), finally decided on starting on paper recycling since that isn’t implemented in the school already; which it should have. We found companies that were willing to recycling the papers. So, in the weekend, I went out to department stores to find a proper size and shape for recycling bins. I’m planning on buying them and placing them throughout the school to finally start the project.</p>

						<p><strong>Service </strong>During the month of October, i’m planning to start a fundraising event to help spread awareness and raise money for breast cancer. I’ve already looked up a charity to donate to and talked to the school Administration in preparation for it. The plan includes starting a bake sale to raise money for organization and plan out other events to raise awareness for a really serious issue. I hope for this event to be successful and for it to be a reoccurring each year in the month of October.</p>

						<h2>MiSK Module</h2>
					</header>
					<div class="content">
						<p><strong>Action </strong>During the course of the weekend, Abdulaziz and I met with our MiSK facilitators in Riyadh to start the second module of the RMAS MiSK program. We took part in a wide variety of team building exercises that improve my leadership and follower-ship abilities in the long term. The program took place in a venue in Riyadh, starting from 8 in the morning to 10 in the evening. It was a hectic and exhausting two days but at the end of the second day, we gathered to see the work of the brilliant minds of the MiSK students and the result of months of work. It was a life changing experience and I wish to build up on it in the future.</p>

						<h2>Web Design</h2>
					</header>
					<div class="content">
						<p><strong>Service </strong>Months before the largest model united nations conference in the kingdom, I was tasked with a peer to redesign their official website. It took hours to plan out the initial design and create the “landing page” or the home page of the website. After the first design, we decided that it was not “good enough”, so we redesigned it a second time with a theme that could be replicated throughout the site. Again, it took hours to design the home page but approximately 20 minutes per page. The final result was decent, but we thought we could do better if we were to redesign it a third time. (We did not redesign it a third time)</p>

						<p><strong>Service </strong>A week before the school’s G4-12 assembly, I was tasked to manage the IT part of the assembly. I setup the keynote presentation and edited the videos that were to be displayed in the assembly. But when we got there to setup, it turned out that the system in place in the multiple purpose room did not support Apple devices. We tried a new generation MacBook and an iPad as backups, but both did not work. We ended up transferring to a Windows device that did not support most file formats that the presentation was setup to use.</p>

I spent my time, from 11AM to 7PM, three days in a row volunteering in King Faisal School. I enjoyed meeting new people and catching up with older friends. It was more organized than the previous year thanks to proper feedback given to the organizers. But, nonetheless, it was not as organized as it should have been.</p>

						<p><strong>Activity </strong>In the summer of 2019, I travelled to Jeddah to study for a period of two months as a part of my sponsorship by the MiSK foundation. Throughout the time I spent in the King Abdullah University for Science and Technology, I prepared for my SAT and TOEFL exams for eight hours a day, five days a week. I had the opportunity to tour multiple “core labs” which are state-of-the-art facilities within the university itself. One of the labs included the “Visual Computing Center” which is the fastest super computer in the region, and one of the fastest in the world. I enjoyed my time in KAUST and I wish I could of stayed longer in Thuwal.</p>

I left to search for the two dogs and successfully found both running around the immediate area. I struggled to get them into the car but after a bit a force and time, they entered the car and I successfully returned them to the owner.</p>

Meetings like these will hopefully continue to be organized by future student government presidents as it involves the study body in the whole decision processes.</p>

These would take up a significant amount of my free time but it was my duty as the President of the Student Government. Many of these issues got resolved but some did not because the administration would be against certain changes because they would be deemed too ‘radical’.</p>

I stopped on the side to ensure that the motorist was fine and did not require assistance. We talked briefly and came to the conclusion that the best way forward was to use my car to push his to the side of the road for his safety and the safety of other drivers. After successfully doing so, I called a tow truck and we exchanged numbers.</p>

						<p><strong>Service </strong>During the winter break, I travelled to the Eastern region to visit family members. I had the opportunity to visit the family farm and, without hesitation, I agreed. After getting a quick tour of the place, I was able to help out with the production (since the farm is used to provide meat to local butchers). I helped move feed and operate the machinery used. Seeing animals that weren’t confined to small inhumane conditions was great, especially in a world where all our meat come from intensive animal farming facilities.</p>
